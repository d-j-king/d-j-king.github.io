    <section class="about">
      <p>
        I am a research fellow at the <a href="https://thefai.org">Foundation for American Innovation</a>,
        where I work on AI policy, with a focus on infrastructure: data centers, grid modernization, and power generation. I've published and testified on accelerating the buildout of compute campuses as well as behind-the-meter generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I write <a href="https://www.policygradients.com/">Policy Gradients</a>, a newsletter
        making sense of the AI and energy landscape. Previously, I did data science research and worked at a power generation startup, where I designed computational fluid dynamics experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
        I earned an MA in statistics as well as a dual bachelors, with a BS in mechanical engineering and BA in applied mathematics. In a past life, I studied classical flute performance.
